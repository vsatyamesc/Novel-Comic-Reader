# Novel-Comic-Reader
A Novel/Comic Reader website made for personal use. Only Single Comic/Novel for now. Made using ReactJS and ExpressJS.

# Important
This Project was created with Sole purpose of hosting my own novel/comic. As I like to draw I plan to make my own comic one day so I thought why not this too. If anyone uses this template, I'm not responsible for anything a person does with it.

# Before you build
> Edit Description.json files inside Folder File
> 
> You need to build with either chapter-render.js - for novels or with chapter-render-image.js for comics
> 
> Rather than using a DBMS for Storing chapter information, it uses JSON files inside folders pointing to the image link. Since it was only made for single comic, and so reducing the need for security.
>
> Read all the files properly and make change according to yourself.

# Build
```npm run build```
